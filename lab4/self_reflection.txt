All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: use capacity resize instead of two method will avoid repeating code.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: Resize copy, reset the array, so addFirst and add Last method can easily work.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: several code can be replace with helper functions.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: Avoid code repeating.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: It is a circle list.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: write less repeated code.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: Sentinel node.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: Properly the remove function.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: the testing code.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A: java visualize is quite usefull.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: the importance of testing.

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: write test first.

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?
